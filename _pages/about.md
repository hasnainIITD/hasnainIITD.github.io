Hey, thanks for stopping by!

I am a Research Fellow at the [School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mae), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I was supervised by [Sameer Alam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-sameer-alam-151388a1?originalSubdomain=sg) during my Ph.D (2018-2022) at [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). Earlier, I obtained my masters (2016-2018) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). 
 
As a data enthusiast, I am perennially interested in finding meaningful patterns and deriving actionable insights from data. In my <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/160021">PhD</a>, I have worked on develpoing data-driven decision systems and autonomous control agents to manage increased air traffic. I proposed `machine learning` models that can approximate the `uncertainty`, inherent in an airport environment and recommend intelligent aircraft pushbacks to minimize airport airside congestion, fuel burn and related emissions. Moreover, the developed algorithms can be adapted to design other `control systems` that require intelligent decision making to satisfy competing demands of multiple stakeholders with limited information.

I am currently leading the Airport research team at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/atmri">ATMRI</a>, working towards automating airport ground movements. We aim to increase the capacity and efficiency of current airport airside operations by reducing taxi congestion (delays) and improving aircraft adherence to Target Take Off Time. We are developing learning-based methods for multi-agent control and coordination. In this novel approach, departure aircraft are seen as decentralised agents which are trained not only to optimize individual aircraft trajectory, but also to collaborate for reducing airport-wide congestion while meeting operational constraints. 

In my spare time, I enjoy running, traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. I can be contacted via other social platforms (see bottom of the page).

<!-- My research interests include data science and machine learning applied to intelligent transportation systems. In my recently awarded PhD (July-2022), supervised by [Prof. Sameer Alam](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00160), I have developed novel machine learning algorithms to minimize airport airside congestion by intelligently controlling aircraft pushbacks. I am currently leading a software development project, at [Air Traffic Management Research Institute, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/atmri), that aims to integrate the machine learnt models with Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) tools to assist ATCO decision making under uncertainties. The developed software can be adapted to solve other similar transportation and logistical problems that require intelligent decision making to satisfy competing demands of multiple stakeholders with limited information. To further my research interests, I am currently researching about multi agent systems and decision making under uncertainty. -->
