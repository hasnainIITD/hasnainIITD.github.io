  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

algorithms in recent years have been shown to perform data mining tasks with ease by many research studies conducted for very

for food and is influenced by nature inspired computing paradigms. Computationally,Ant Colony Optimizationexplores and
exploits solution space to find fairly accurate solutions in less time.Classification is a data mining function which assigns input
values to two or more designated classesof output, with the goal of accurately predicting target class for new input
data.Discriminant analysis which falls under the broad gambit of classification data mining, is the statistical mapping of data
values to one of the two predefined groups. In this study, the application of Ant Colony Optimizationto perform discriminant
analysis has been explored.Predictive classification accuracy ofeighty-six percent has been achieved on an ordinal data set for the
combination of one thousand ants and twenty-five instances (minimum) covered by one rule.Comparative analysis of the quality

  abstract={Low cost carriers usually operate from no-frills budget terminals which are designed for quick
aircraft turnaround, faster passenger connections with minimal inter-gate passenger transfer times. Such
operations are highly sensitive to factors such as aircraft delays, turnaround time and flight connection time
and may lead to missed connections for self-connecting transfer passengers. In this paper, we propose a
passenger-centric model to analyze the effect of turnaround times, minimum connection times and stochastic
delays on missed connections of self-connecting passengers. We use Singapore Changi International Airport
Terminal 4, which mainly caters to budget/low cost carriers, as a case study to demonstrate the impact of
operational uncertainties on these passenger connections, considering an optimal gate assignment by using
heuristic search for scheduled arrivals. The proposed model also incorporates reassignment of gates in the
disrupted scenario to minimize spatial deviation from the optimized gate assignments. Results show that the
chances of missed connections can be significantly reduced by operationally maintaining higher turnaround
time and minimum connection time and by bringing down delays at the airport. Specifically, by maintaining
the flight turnaround time at 50 min, minimum connection time at 60 min and by containing arrival delays
within 70% of the current delay spread at Terminal 4, transfer passenger missed connections can be prevented
for almost all the flights. The gate assignment method adopted in this study is generic and may help to identify
the gates, which are more prone to missed connections given operational uncertainties under different flight
scenarios.}

  abstract={Airports across the world are expanding by building multiple ground control towers and resorting to complex taxiway and runway system, in response to growing air traffic. Current outcome- based ground safety management at the airside may impede our potential to learn from and adapt to evolving air traffic scenarios, owing to the sparsity of accidents when compared with number of daily airside operations. To augment airside ground safety at Singapore Changi airport, in this study, we predict dynamic hot spots- areas where multiple aircraft may come in close vicinity on taxiways, as pre-cursor events to airside conflicts. We use airside infrastructure and A-SMGCS operations data of Changi airport to model aircraft arrival at different taxiway intersections both in temporal and spatial dimensions. The statistically learnt spatial-temporal model is then used to compute conflict probability at identified intersections, in order to evaluate conflict coefficients or hotness values of hot spots. These hot spots are then visually displayed on the aerodrome diagram for heightened attention of ground ATCOs. In the Subjective opinion of Ground Movement Air Traffic Controller, highlighted Hot Spots make sense and leads to better understanding of taxiway movements and increased situational awareness. Future research shall incorporate detailed human-in-the-loop validation of the dynamic hot spot model by ATCOs in 360 degree tower simulator.},

  abstract={Airport departure metering can contain airside congestion but it may adversely impact scheduled gate assignments leading to passenger missed connections. Using an integrated landside airside framework, this study aims at evaluating the impact of departure metering on connecting flights and passenger connections. The proposed framework comprises of landside and airside simulators where the landside simulator simulates transfer passenger movements conditioned upon minimum connection time and the airside simulator simulates runway and taxiway movements based on planned operations and available data source. Departing aircraft movements are then metered to reduce taxi and take-off delays under uncertainties. Delayed arrivals and/or departures may lead to conflicts at gate rendering planned gate assignments infeasible or impractical. Using Singapore Changi airport A-SMGCS data, as a case study, it is found that DM may transfer as much as 12 minutes of waiting time from taxiways to gates. This leads to increased gate conflicts which additionally delays the gate-in time of an arriving aircraft by 2-7 minutes on average. Gate reassignments were found to significantly reduce both the number of gate conflicts and arrival queuing time at gates leading to less passenger delays. A minimum connection time of 70 minutes is found sufficient to reduce the probability of missed connections for transfer passengers.},

  abstract={Airport taxi delays adversely affect airports and airlines around the world leading to airside congestion, increased Air Traffic Controllers/Pilot workload, and adverse environmental impact due to excessive fuel burn. Airport Departure Metering (DM) is an effective approach to contain taxi delays by controlling departure pushback timings. The key idea behind DM is to transfer aircraft waiting time from taxiways to gates. State-of-the-art DM methods use model-based control policies that rely on airside departure modeling to obtain simplified analytical equations. Consequently, these models fail to capture non-stationarity in the airside operations leading to poor performance of control policies under uncertainties. This work proposes model-free and learning-based DM using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to reduce taxi delays while meeting flight schedule constraints. This paper casts the DM problem in a markov decision process framework and develops a representative airport-airside simulator to simulate airside operations and evaluate the learnt DM policy. For effective state representation, this work introduces taxiway hotspot features to account for the spatial-temporal evolution of airside congestion levels. This significantly improves the DM policy convergence rate during training. The performance of the learnt policy is evaluated under different traffic densities with a reduction of approximately 44% in taxi out delays, in medium-density traffic scenarios, which corresponds to 2-minute savings in taxi-out time per aircraft. Furthermore, benchmarking DRL against an evolutionary method and another state-of-the-art simulation-based heuristic demonstrates the superior performance of our method, especially in high traffic density scenarios. With increased traffic density, taxi-time savings achieved by the learnt DM policy increase without a significant decrease in runway throughput. Results, on a typical day of simulated operations at Singapore Changi Airport, demonstrate that DRL can learn an effective DM policy to contain congestion on the taxiways, reduce total fuel consumption by approximately 22% and better manage the airside traffic.}
