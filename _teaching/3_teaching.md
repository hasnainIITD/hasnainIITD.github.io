Due to its strategic importance, Singapore is controlling the air traffic flows to and from its neighbouring countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia and covers the South China Sea. 

Aim
======
The course aims to analyse and compare post-simulation results of Real-Time Air Traffic Control RADAR Simulator by controlling Approach traffic using NARSIM. Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCO) plays an important role in managing the traffic with an emphasis of safety through radio/telephony or datalink


Learning Objectives
======
By completing this project, students will 
* Learn about air traffic control in the approach phase of flight.
* Understanding factors affecting “human-in-the-loop operation” while resolving conflicts in the air and minimising the effect of weather (wind).


Experimental Techniques
======
Several simulation scenarios will be run and the hardware of the simulator is driven by
specialized software, NARSIM. All aircraft manoeuvres in Real-Time Simulation are performed by pseudo pilots for humanin-the-loop studies.

TA Duration
======
Taught the course for 1 semester from Aug-2019 to Dec-2019.
