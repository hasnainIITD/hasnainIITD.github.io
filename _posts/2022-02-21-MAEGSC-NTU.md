Scientific presentations play a very important role in the life of a researcher during PhD years and beyond, which unfortunately many researchers do not appreciate enough. Not surprisingly, it is a huge stress to look at most PowerPoint slides.

<blockquote>
     Depending on the “design” skills of the speaker and audience’s taste slides create different emotions from a slight annoyance to physical sickness.
</blockquote>

The workshop covered universal design principles, templates, colors, typefaces, slides’ typography, use of photos and pictograms, composition rules and ways to create clear and meaningful charts and diagrams. Participants were divided into groups and supported by office bearers and other volunteers to apply the learned principles themselves using an application like Google Slides, followed by a short discussion on how their slides can be compared to a “model” slide.
