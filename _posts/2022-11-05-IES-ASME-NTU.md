The purpose of this Python workshop is to introduce more advanced Python programming for data science to NTU undergraduates. It is hoped that this introductory workshop to Python Programming for Data Science may spark interest in the participants to delve deeper into programming and data science in general.

In this 3-hour long workshop, I discussed and demonstrated to NTU undergraduates the data exploration and visualization capabilities using Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn). This was followed by a hands-on session wherein participants were tasked to perform data visualization tasks using [World-Happiness-Report-Data](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/). Refer [Data Exploration & Visualisation Workshop](https://hasanain-ali.github.io/files/IES_ASME_NTU_poster.jpg) for more details.
